    "This lab is a tutorial (primarily based on [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/examples/tokenizer_training.ipynb)) of the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), which is a set of Python APIs that enable you to train and use state-of-the-art transformer neural networks. There are two components that we need to become familar with: (a) tokenizers, and (b) transformer models. We will discuss transformer models in Lecture/Lab 09, but it's prudent to first learn how these models consume text, as this in and of itself consists of a set of complex procedures and embedded learning problems. Luckily, Huggingface has abstracted nearly all of this complexity away for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is broken down into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading a corpus to train our tokenizer\n",
    "2. Using pre-trained tokenizers\n",
    "3. Training a tokenizer from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverable for this lab is to use the methods learned in section 3 to train a custom word piece tokenizer on the [DBpedia14 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dbpedia_14) (see Task-1 at end of notebook).\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will see several ways to train your own tokenizer from scratch on a given corpus, so you can then use it to train a language model from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you need to *train* a tokenizer? That's because Transformer models very often use subword tokenization algorithms, and they need to be trained to identify the parts of words that are often present in the corpus you are using. We recommend you take a look at the [tokenization chapter](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter2/4?fw=pt) of the Hugging Face course for a general introduction on tokenizers, and at the [tokenizers summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/tokenizer_summary.html) for a look at the differences between the subword tokenization algorithms."
